# CS50P Projects

This repository contains my solutions and projects from **Harvard University's CS50P — Introduction to Programming with Python**.  
The course introduces fundamental programming concepts through practical assignments, focusing on clean, readable, and efficient Python code.

## Course Overview

CS50P is a Python-based introduction to programming that covers:

- Functions, conditionals, and loops  
- Data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples  
- File I/O and exceptions  
- Unit testing and debugging  
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)  
- Regular expressions  
- Libraries and APIs (Requests, Pillow, JSON, CSV)
